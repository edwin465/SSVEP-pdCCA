# SSVEP-pdCCA

Recently, the multi-frequency-modulated visual stimulation paradigm has been shown effective for the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). 

## What is the multi-frequency-modulated visual stimulation paradigm? 
In the multi-frequency-modulated visual stimulation paradigm, **each visual target is encoded with more than one frequency**. 
For example, more than one frequency are used to drive one visual target in different timeslots [1-5], drive one visual target at the same time (e.g., the frequency modulation and the amplitude modulation) [6,7], and drive two flickers (each visual target consists of two flickers) at the same time [8-10], respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 1.

## What is the phase difference constrained CCA (pdCCA)?
The canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is widely used to identify the stimulus frequency from the single-frequency-modulated SSVEPs in the traditional SSVEP-based BCIs. Many experiment results have demonstrated that the CCA can provide an acceptable accuracy. In addition, the CCA is ease-to-use and conveniently applied into many different scenarios. Importantly, the CCA is `calibration-free`.

In the literature, the CCA has been applied in the multi-frequency-modulated SSVEP-based BCIs. However, the existing CCA performance might not be optimal. Because the CCA usually neglect the phase features of the SSVEPs. In the multi-frequency-modulated visual stimulation paradigm, the multiple frequency components of SSVEPs are phase-locked to the multiple visual stimuli, and thus the phase differences between different frequency components should be constrained. **The traditional CCA is incapable of extracting these phase difference features in the recognition**.

In this project, we utilize the phase difference feature to improve the recognition accuracy of the CCA. **We develop a phase difference constrained CCA (pdCCA)**.  

## An example of the pdCCA for MFSC visual stimulation paradigm

First, we introduct the CCA method for MFSC visual stimulation paradigm. According to [4], the CCA is used to the spatial filters $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ to maximize the correlation $r$ between the SSVEP $\mathbf{X}$ and reference signal $\mathbf{Y}$ after spatial filtering, i.e.,  

```math
r_j=\max_{\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}}{\frac{\mathbf{u}^\top\mathbf{X}_j^\top\mathbf{Y}_{CCA}\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{\mathbf{u}^\top \mathbf{X}_j^\top\mathbf{X}_j\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}^\top\mathbf{Y}_{CCA}^\top\mathbf{Y}_{CCA}\mathbf{v}}}}=\mathrm{CCA}(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y}_{CCA}),
```  

and  

```math
\mathbf{Y}_{CCA} = \left[\begin{array}{c}
    \sin (2\pi f_{k,j} t)\\
    \cos (2\pi f_{k,j} t)\\
    \vdots\\
    \sin (2\pi N_h f_{k,j} t)\\
    \cos (2\pi N_h f_{k,j} t)\\    
	\end{array}\right]^\top = \left[\begin{array}{c}
    \mathbf{\Gamma}_{f_{k,j}}^\top\\
    \mathbf{\Gamma}_{2\cdot f_{k,j}}^\top\\
    \vdots\\
    \mathbf{\Gamma}_{N_h f_{k,j}}^\top
	\end{array}\right]^\top
```

where $f_{k,j}$ is the $j$-th stimulus frequency of the $k$-th visual target, $j=1,2,3,4$, and $k=1,2,\cdots,160$. The final recognition result is determined by

```math
\hat{k} =\max_{k}{\{r_{k,1}+r_{k,2}+r_{k,3}+r_{k,4}\}} 
```

Second, we introduce the proposed pdCCA. The pdCCA is a CCA under a predefined phase difference constraint. Specifically, the phase of the sine-cosine reference signal is determined by the stimulus phase. In addition, the sine and cosine basis functions of $\mathbf{Y}_{pdCCA}$ for different frequencies are concatenated horizontally
